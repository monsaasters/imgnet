## Overview

Traditional similarity metrics such as cosine similarity compare embedding vectors through **global angular relationships**.

**IMG** introduces a different paradigm: instead of comparing absolute vector values, IMG compares **local relational patterns** inside the embedding.

The proposed framework consists of three complementary metrics:

1. **IMG Sign Score**
2. **AMP IMG Score**
3. **Chain Score**

> **Note:** This work does **not** propose replacing cosine similarity. Instead, IMG is proposed as an *alternative* similarity metric. Experimental results suggest that the optimal similarity metric depends on how the embedding itself is learned.

## Relational Learning Hypothesis

In Javanese, one expresses gratitude as **"matur suwun"**; in Sundanese, the same sentiment is conveyed as **"hatur nuhun"**. Despite different surface structures, both phrases encode identical meaning through internally consistent relational patterns.

This linguistic observation inspired the central hypothesis of this work:

> **Identity can be encoded through consistent relational patterns rather than absolute values.**

Instead of forcing embeddings to occupy a specific angular position, the proposed method trains the network to preserve **local relational consistency**.

Consequently, similarity is evaluated by comparing relational patterns rather than absolute vector orientation.

## Relational Training Objective

Unlike ArcFace, which explicitly optimizes cosine similarity using Angular Margin Loss,

```math
L_{ArcFace}
=
-\log
\frac
{e^{s\cos(\theta_y+m)}}
{e^{s\cos(\theta_y+m)}+\sum_j e^{s\cos\theta_j}}
```

the proposed method directly optimizes the desired similarity metric itself.

For two embeddings

```math
E_1,E_2\in\mathbb{R}^{1024}
```

the objective is to maximize their **local sign agreement**.

### Soft Sign Agreement

For each embedding dimension,

```math
a_i=
\frac{\tanh(\beta E_{1,i}E_{2,i})+1}{2}
```

where:

- positive product → agreement
- negative product → disagreement

Unlike a hard sign comparison, the hyperbolic tangent provides a smooth differentiable approximation.

### Sliding Window Aggregation

For each sliding window,

```math
S_k=\sum_{i=k}^{k+W-1}a_i
```

where:

- Window size **W = 11**
- Threshold **T = 8**

### Differentiable Matching Gate

```math
M_k=\sigma\left(50(S_k-T+0.5)\right)
```

which approximates

```math
M_k \approx
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } S_k \ge T \\
0 & \text{if } S_k < T
\end{cases}
```

while remaining differentiable.

### IMG Sign Score

```math
IMG(E_1,E_2)=\frac1N\sum_{k=1}^{N}M_k
```

where

```math
N=d-W+1
```

### Relational Loss

Positive pairs:

```math
L_{same}=(1-IMG)^2
```

Negative pairs:

```math
L_{diff}=IMG^2
```

Final objective:

```math
L=L_{same}+L_{diff}
```

This is exactly the objective used during training.

## Training Pipeline

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Dataset | CASIA-WebFace |
| Identities | 10,572 |
| Images | ~490k aligned faces |
| Embedding Dimension | 1024 |
| Batch Size | 16 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Learning Rate | 1×10⁻⁴ |
| Epochs | 50 |
| Warm-up | 5 |
| Scheduler | Cosine Annealing |
| Weight Decay | 1×10⁻⁵ |

Positive pairs consist of two images belonging to the same identity, while negative pairs are randomly sampled from different identities.

Unlike ArcFace, no angular-margin loss, cosine loss, or triplet loss is used. The network is optimized **entirely using the proposed relational objective**.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

Traditional face-recognition losses optimize embeddings for cosine similarity.

The proposed approach instead optimizes embeddings directly for the intended inference metric.

Consequently:

- Embeddings trained with **Angular Margin Loss** naturally favor **cosine similarity**.
- Embeddings trained with the proposed **relational loss** naturally favor **IMG Sign**.

This suggests that **the similarity metric and the embedding loss should be designed together rather than independently.**

## Benchmark

### SW357 Embedding (native)

| Dataset | IMG Sign | AMP | Chain | Cosine |
|----------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| LFW | 96.27% | 90.45% | 95.12% | 95.53% |
| AgeDB-30 | 78.80% | 74.22% | 72.87% | 77.22% |
| CALFW | 78.73% | 74.92% | 76.87% | 78.32% |
| CPLFW | 76.85% | 68.88% | 75.23% | 74.62% |
| **Combined** | **81.02%** | **77.41%** | **79.30%** | **79.49%** |

### ArcFace Evaluation (relational metric tested on external embedding)

| Dataset | IMG Sign | AMP | Chain | Cosine |
|----------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| LFW | 99.58% | 99.48% | 97.02% | 99.82% |
| AgeDB-30 | 96.85% | 93.92% | 73.62% | 98.07% |
| CALFW | 95.62% | 94.52% | 84.18% | 96.10% |
| CPLFW | 93.22% | 91.33% | 77.13% | 94.45% |

**Observation:** Cosine remains the best metric for ArcFace because ArcFace is explicitly optimized using Angular Margin Loss. However, IMG Sign remains highly competitive despite never being used during ArcFace training.

---

## Main Finding

Results suggest that **Similarity Metric** and **Embedding Loss Function** should be considered together:

- Embeddings trained with **Angular Margin Loss** naturally favor **cosine similarity**.
- Embeddings trained with the proposed **relational loss** naturally favor **IMG Sign**.

**Therefore, there is no universally best similarity metric.** The optimal metric depends on how the embedding space is learned.

        s1 = np.where(e1[i:i+WINDOW_SIZE] >= 0, 1, -1)
        s2 = np.where(e2[i:i+WINDOW_SIZE] >= 0, 1, -1)
        if np.sum(s1 == s2) >= THRESHOLD:
            mc += 1
    return mc / n
```

### AMP IMG Score

```python
def amp_img_score_np(e1, e2):
    n = len(e1) - WINDOW_SIZE + 1
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        w1 = e1[i:i+WINDOW_SIZE]
        w2 = e2[i:i+WINDOW_SIZE]
        s1 = np.where(w1 >= 0, 1, -1)
        s2 = np.where(w2 >= 0, 1, -1)
        if np.sum(s1 == s2) >= THRESHOLD:
            a1 = np.mean(np.abs(w1))
            a2 = np.mean(np.abs(w2))
            total += max(0, 1 - abs(a1 - a2) / max(a1, a2, 1e-6))
    return total / n
```

### Chain Score

```python
def chain_score_np(e1, e2):
    n = len(e1) - WINDOW_SIZE + 1
    flags = []
    for i in range(n):
        ...
    total = sum(flags)
    img_sign = total / n
    ...
    avg_chain = total / n_chains
    diff = avg_chain - NEUTRAL_LEN
    score = img_sign + (
        REWARD_RATE * diff
        if diff >= 0
        else PUNISH_RATE * diff
    ) / 100
    return np.clip(score, 0, 1)
```

## IMG as a Universal Similarity Library

IMG is no longer just a face-recognition metric. The core metrics are packaged
as a generic Python library that can be applied to **any 1-D embedding vectors**:
face, audio, text, protein structure, recommendation vectors, etc.
 
### Install as a package
 
```bash
# Editable install for development
git clone https://github.com/imamgh11/imgnet.git
cd imgnet
pip install -e .
 
# With API extras
pip install -e .[api]
```
 
### Python API
 
```python
from imgnet.metrics import batch_compare, img_sign_score, cosine_similarity
 
# Two embeddings from any model
e1 = [...]  # list or 1-D numpy array
e2 = [...]
 
# Single metric
print(img_sign_score(e1, e2))      # IMG Sign Score
print(cosine_similarity(e1, e2))   # cosine baseline
 
# Full comparison with voting
result = batch_compare(e1, e2)
print(result)
# {
#   "img_sign": 0.82,
#   "amp_img": 0.79,
#   "chain_score": 0.81,
#   "cosine": 0.35,
#   "vote": "MATCH",
#   "chains": 12,
#   "avg_chain": 6.5
# }
```

imgnet verify emb_a.npy emb_b.npy --json
 
# Single metric only
imgnet verify emb_a.npy emb_b.npy --metric cosine
```
 
Supported embedding formats:
- `.npy` — numpy arrays saved with `np.save`
- `.json` — JSON list, or object with `embedding` / `vector` key
 
### FastAPI server
 
```bash
uvicorn imgnet.api:app --reload
# Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
 
Example request:
 
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/compare" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "a": [0.1, -0.5, ...],
    "b": [0.2, -0.4, ...],
    "threshold": 0.79
  }'
```
 
---

## Voting System
 
Three metrics, one threshold (from IMG Sign sweep):
 
```
2/3 or 3/3 pass → ✅ MATCH
1/3 pass        → ⚠️  UNCERTAIN
0/3 pass        → ❌ DIFFERENT
```

Experimental Findings (Preliminary)

diff person

During development of the interactive ablation visualizer, a preliminary observation was made using the custom polygon occlusion tool:

Observation: Region-specific embedding sensitivity

When occluding specific facial regions (e.g., right eye) using a custom polygon mask and comparing the resulting embedding changes across two different individuals:


Same person, different photos: occluding the same region produces delta spikes at similar embedding dimensions across both photos
Different people: occluding the same region produces delta spikes at different embedding dimensions, or in some cases near-zero delta for one person (e.g., when glasses obscure the region)


Example (custom polygon, right eye region):

Same person:
  Photo 1: changed 4/1014 windows = 0.4%  spike_delta: 110
  Photo 2: changed 1/1014 windows = 0.1%  spike_delta: 100
  → spike locations visually correlated

Different people:
  Photo 1: changed 4/1014 windows = 0.4%  spike_delta: 110
  Photo 2: changed 0/1014 windows = 0.0%  spike_delta: 97
  → spike locations differ significantly

This observation suggests that the IMG Sign MSE loss function, through its overlapping sliding window structure, may induce implicit spatial organization in the embedding space — where different facial regions influence different embedding dimensions. However, this has not yet been formally tested and should be treated as a preliminary observation pending rigorous evaluation.


⚠️ This is an informal observation from the visualization tool, not a validated experimental result. Formal ablation study with multiple identities and statistical analysis is planned as future work.

## Domain-Agnostic Potential (Beyond Computer Vision)

While evaluated on face verification, the core mathematics of the **IMG Framework** are inherently domain-agnostic. Because it discards absolute magnitude dependency and focuses entirely on local sign-pattern agreements, this framework can be generalized to non-visual embeddings:

*   **Audio & Speech Processing:** By applying IMG to audio spectrogram embeddings, the metric can eliminate amplitude/volume variations (gain changes), establishing a noise-robust framework for voice biometrics.
*   **Structural Bioinformatics:** In protein structural analysis, exact physical distances fluctuate due to environment/simulations. IMG can be applied to capture invariant relational topology patterns between amino acids rather than relying on strict absolute spatial coordinates.

---
## ONNX Export

IMGNet Conv10 is available in ONNX format for deployment without PyTorch.

**Why it was non-trivial to export:**
SW Block uses non-standard operations (boolean mask indexing + reflect padding) that are not directly ONNX-compatible. The solution: boolean mask replaced with explicit neighbor loops, and reflect padding emulated via `flip + concat` — mathematically identical but fully ONNX-safe across all runtimes.

**Verification:**
```
PyTorch vs ONNX cosine similarity : 1.000000
PyTorch vs ONNX max difference    : 0.00000033
```

**Inference:**
```python
import onnxruntime as rt
import numpy as np

sess     = rt.InferenceSession("imgnet_conv10_epoch39.onnx")
inp_name = sess.get_inputs()[0].name

# img: np.uint8 (112, 112, 3) — face aligned to 112×112
t   = img.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
t   = t.transpose(2, 0, 1)[np.newaxis]    # (1, 3, 112, 112)
emb = sess.run(None, {inp_name: t})[0][0]  # (1024,)
```

**Threshold** (from LFW benchmark sweep, epoch 39): `0.79`

```python
n_pass = sum([img_sign(e1,e2) >= 0.79,
              amp_img(e1,e2)  >= 0.79,
              chain(e1,e2)    >= 0.79])
# 2/3 or 3/3 → MATCH | 1/3 → UNCERTAIN | 0/3 → DIFFERENT
```
---

## Conclusion

IMG is proposed as an alternative similarity metric rather than a replacement for cosine similarity. Experiments indicate that cosine similarity performs best for embeddings trained with angular-margin objectives, while IMG Sign performs best for embeddings trained with the proposed relational objective. The framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to embeddings generated by different architectures.

## Occlusion Robustness Benchmark
 
To demonstrate that IMG metrics can be more stable than cosine under
perturbations, this repo includes a lightweight benchmark that applies
synthetic noise/occlusion directly to embedding vectors and compares metric
degradation.
 
Run:
```bash
python -m imgnet.benchmark
```
 
Or use it programmatically:
```python
from imgnet.benchmark import run_benchmark, summarize, to_csv, BenchmarkConfig, EmbeddingPair
import numpy as np
 
pairs = [
    EmbeddingPair("same_1", "same", np.random.randn(1024), np.random.randn(1024)),
    EmbeddingPair("diff_1", "different", np.random.randn(1024), np.random.randn(1024)),
]
 
results = run_benchmark(pairs, BenchmarkConfig())
print(summarize(results))
to_csv(results, Path("benchmark_results.csv"))
```
 
Outputs:
- `benchmark_results.csv`
- `benchmark_results.json`

    data_root="./data/casia-webface",
    ckpt_root="./checkpoints",
    num_epochs=50,
    hybrid_mode=True,
    hybrid_cosine_weight=0.5,
)
